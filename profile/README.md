# RachNerd
We aim to create a Python framework that combines the functionalities of both backend and frontend development without relying on external tools like Node.js, Django, or React.js.

The purpose of our project is to develop a comprehensive Python-based framework that integrates the features of traditional backend frameworks like Django with the capabilities of modern frontend frameworks like React.js. This framework will provide developers with a single, unified solution for building web applications, eliminating the need for separate backend and frontend tools.

Key goals and features of the framework include:

1. Full-stack Python Development: The framework will allow developers to write both backend and frontend code using Python, providing a consistent and streamlined development experience.

2. Backend Functionality: The framework will encompass essential backend functionalities such as routing, database integration, user authentication, session management, and data modeling, similar to Django.

3. Frontend Capabilities: The framework will offer frontend capabilities, enabling developers to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces using Python-based templates, components, and libraries, comparable to React.js.

4. Efficient Development Workflow: The framework will prioritize developer productivity by providing efficient development workflows, including features like automatic code reloading, hot module replacement, and efficient build processes.

5. Extensibility and Customization: Developers will have the ability to extend and customize the framework according to their project requirements, leveraging the flexibility and power of Python's ecosystem.

6. Performance and Scalability: The framework will strive to deliver high performance and scalability, ensuring that web applications built with it can handle increased traffic and user demands effectively.

7. Documentation and Community Support: The framework will provide thorough and comprehensive documentation, along with an active and supportive community to assist developers in understanding and utilizing its features effectively.
8. Virtual DOM

By creating a Python framework that combines the functionalities of both backend and frontend development, We aim to simplify the development process, reduce the reliance on external tools, and provide a seamless and cohesive environment for building web applications.

## Road Map

**Short-term goals:**

* **Release the first version of the framework that supports basic frontend and backend functionality.**
* **Create a community around the framework and start building a user base.**
* **Gather feedback from users and improve the framework based on their feedback.**
* **Release the framework as an open-source project.**


**Long-term goals:**

* **Add support for more frontend libraries and database integrations.**
* **Add more features, such as routing, authentication, session management, and data modeling.**
* **Make the framework more scalable and performant.**
